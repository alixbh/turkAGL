# baby-saffran

This an experiment template for when you want to expose participants to an
audio stimulus and then test them on what they have learned.  Experiments that
fall into this category include statistical and distributional learning
experiments such as:

- Word-segmentation (Saffran, Hebrew, etc.)
- Category learning (QAXBR)
- Phrase-structure learning (Thompson & Newport)


There are two phases in this experiment:
1. Exposure phase - participants are exposed to a language (via a single audio file or
  a list of audio files)
2. Test phase - participants take a grammaticality judgement task
